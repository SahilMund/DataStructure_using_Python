#! Algorithms

# ? What is Algorithms ?
#   An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions in sequence to solve a problem.

# ? Qualities of a good algorithm :-

"""
1. Input and output should be defined precisely.
2. Each step in the algorithm should be clear and unambiguous.
3. Algorithms should be most effective among many different ways to solve a problem.
4. An algorithm shouldn't include computer code. Instead, the algorithm should
   be written in such a way that it can be used in different programming languages.

"""

# ? Example :-

# Algorithm to add two numbers entered by the user

"""
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables num1, num2 and sum. 
Step 3: Read values num1 and num2. 
Step 4: Add num1 and num2 and assign the result to sum.
        sum←num1+num2 
Step 5: Display sum 
Step 6: Stop
"""

# Factorial of a number entered by the user.

"""
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Declare variables n, factorial and i.
Step 3: Initialize variables
          factorial ← 1
          i ← 1
Step 4: Read value of n
Step 5: Repeat the steps until i = n
     5.1: factorial ← factorial*i
     5.2: i ← i+1
Step 6: Display factorial
Step 7: Stop

# ? What are Algorithms ?

# an algorithm is nothing but a mention of steps to solve a problem. They are essentially a solution.

# ? DS & Algo
"""
Programming is all about data structures and algorithms. 
Data structures are used to hold data while algorithms are used to solve the problem using that data.

DS & Algo also teaches you the science of evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm.

Data Structures are the main part of many computer science algorithms as they enable the programmers to handle the data in an efficient way. 
It plays a vitle role in enhancing the performance of a software or a program as the main function of the software is to store and retrieve 
the user's data as fast as possible.


"""

# The time taken by the computer to run code is:-
"""
    Time to run code = number of instructions * time to execute each instruction
"""

# The number of instructions depends on the code you used, and the time taken to execute each code depends on your machine and compiler.

# ? Needs of DataStructure

"""
Memory is expensive
Memory is not always available in abundance.
 While dealing with code/system which requires you to store or produce a lot of data,
  it is critical for your algorithm to save the usage of memory wherever possible. 
For example: While storing data about people, you can save memory by storing only their age not the date of birth.
 You can always calculate it on the fly using their age and current date.

1. Processor speed: 
To handle very large amout of data, high speed processing is required, but as the data is growing day by day to the billions of files per entity,
 processor may fail to deal with that much amount of data.

2. Data Search: 
Consider an inventory size of 106 items in a store, If our application needs to search for a particular item, it needs to traverse 106 items every time,
 results in slowing down the search process.

3. Multiple requests:
 If thousands of users are searching the data simultaneously on a web server, then there are the chances that a very large server can be failed during that process.

"""

# ? Advantages of DS:-
"""
 1. less memory consumption.
 2. Easily can optimize our code.
 3. takes less time to execute.
 4. makes a code scalable.
 5. efficient program.
 6. Reusability of codes.
 7. Abstraction
"""

# ? Examples of an Algorithm's Efficiency

# Here are some examples of what learning algorithms and data structures enable you to do:

"""
Example 1: Age Group Problem:-
The binary search algorithm will take only 2 seconds to solve the problem
the naive algorithm might take 1 million seconds, which is around 12 days


Example 2: Rubik's Cube Problem
The way to solve this problem can be represented by the graph data structure.
There is a graph algorithm known as Dijkstra's algorithm which allows you to solve this problem in linear time.
